This Project is based on OpenCV and hence requires you to have OpenCV libraries installed on your system for the program to compile.
It is done as a part of my (Akash Sinha) B.Tech final year project.
For more information about the project, please read the project report.
Here is the link to a video on how the final project looked and worked. Thanks.

NOTE: This program will work on any machine but will show error because it won't be able to access GPIO pins which are available on Beaglebone Black.
	  The GPIO output pins are choosen randomly.
